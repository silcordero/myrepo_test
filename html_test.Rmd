```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Here some sort of data

here for some examples

I am not understand how this works, I can't see this file after commit it ?

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

## Including Plots



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#there
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
